This section captures the principles introduced in the Reference Architecture.  The detail of the principle along with its source (ie the Reference Architecture) is to be captured in the model.

The following principles have been extracts from the discussion:

1. **Reference Architecture is federated.** A federated approach should be taken to develop and maintain a managed library of subject area Reference Architectures at the Business, Information and Technology layers, which individually describe the many diverse lines of business and collectively describe an entire Business Model.
1. **Reference Architecture is timeless.** A Reference Architecture should not include detail on specific organisations, capability systems or business processes. A Reference Architecture guides and constrains instantiated architectures that can describe ‘as-is’ or ‘to-be’ states of the business, it does not directly describe those temporal states. A Reference Architecture should instead describe capability concepts that will remain valid for the foreseeable future.
1. **Reference Architecture requires maintenance.** While Reference Architecture should be developed to remain valid for the foreseeable future, it must be maintained to ensure it remains valid as the business evolves. Standards, Patterns and Decision Frameworks require frequent review and update to maintain their timeless relevance; Standards are revised or deprecated, reusable solutions may be harvested from projects to become Patterns, and changes in the business model will add, remove or change the use cases upon which Decision Frameworks are based.
1. **Reference Architecture requires configuration management.** A Reference Architecture is a Configuration Item and must be approved, maintained and controlled as such. Reference Models, Standards and Patterns should all be modelled in a suitable software modelling tool. All components should be managed in a suitable records management tool.
