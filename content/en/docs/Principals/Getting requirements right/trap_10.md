  Isolating your requirements
---

Viewing requirements as isolated entities, failing to capture relationships between requirements and other artifacts, and failing to recognize dependencies between requirements leads to increased project risk and rework. 
Reprioritizing one requirement without considering its effect on other requirements results in increased project risk and costs.
For example, a risky trap that organizations often succumb to is not capturing the relationship between project requirements, business requirements and other downstream deliverables such as models, test cases and defects. When you fall into this trap, you deliver a product that doesn’t satisfy stakeholder needs.

## Avoid the trap

- Identify relationships between requirements and then manage them together.
- Create the right level of traceability between requirements and downstream deliverables that balances the traceability needed for effective lifecycle management with support for productivity.
- As you make changes to requirements and reprioritize them, consider the effect of these changes to related requirements and your downstream deliverables.
- Use tools that allow you to easily visualize the relationships you’ve identified.

## The payoff

Identifying and managing relationships between requirements and other artifacts mitigates project risk; helps ensure alignment between your business requirements, product requirements and downstream deliverables; and results in lower development costs.
