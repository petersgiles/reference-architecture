 Avoiding the most common traps.
---

## Introduction - Don’t get caught

A trap is a position or situation from which it is difficult or impossible to escape. Getting caught in software development requirement traps can have dire consequences for the survival of your business. The traps of bad requirements definition and management result in cost overruns, missed deadlines, poorly designed products and, ultimately, a failure to deliver what the customer needs. Unfortunately, requirement traps are all too common, and their influence is considerable.

Development management practices are applied to either stay out of trouble or address problems after they are discovered. Development teams anticipate that they’ll fall into traps and to mitigate them they pad budgets and schedules. Here are examples.

- Change the original estimate to reflect the actual results
- Take a stage-gate approach to funding
- Have a flexible budget from the beginning of the project
- Change the original schedule to reflect the actual results
- Pad the budget
- Have a flexible schedule from the beginning of the project
- Have a flexible scope from the beginning of the project
- Will ask for extra funds
- Avoid “scope creep” whenever possible via a “change management” process
- Descope towards the end of the project to meet the deadline
- Indicated that their project teams will extend the schedule to deliver on the promised scope

> Poor requirements management results in inconsistent project outcomes.

Products today increasingly depend on software to deliver their value. A brake sensor on a car, a home appliance, a medical device—these products all contain software that plays an increasingly important role. The products are becoming smarter, and they involve more people and teams outside the typical value chain. Smarter management of the requirements process—***the foundation of effective software delivery***—is increasingly important for delivering these smart products.

Here we present common and devastating mistakes that project teams make in defining and managing requirements. More importantly, it discusses how to avoid these traps so you can get your requirements right and develop the right product on time and within budget.

Becoming familiar with the traps identified here, recognizing them within your organization and avoiding them—preferably at the beginning of your software projects—will help you not only survive in business but also go on to increase marketshare and ROI as you serve the needs of your customers and other stakeholders; help your project delivery teams increase their productivity, quality and reuse; and enable innovation.
