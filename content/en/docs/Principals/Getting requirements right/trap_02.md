    asking customers what they want

This seems counterintuitive. Teams are supposed to talk to customers and give
them what they want in a product. But customers tend to talk about features, not
what they truly need. The truth is that people often don’t know what they want.
And when customers don’t know what they want and developers don’t understand
the problem, poorly conceived solutions—and products—can result.
Avoid the trap

- Ask customers why they need a particular solution. It may lead to a
better understanding of their expectations and better discussions about
specific requirements.
- Guide the discussion away from focusing on features—ask customers what
they want the software to do. Create a separate discussion for how resulting
products will be used.
- Identify the right stakeholders. The target audience or end user may not be the person who is responsible for the project or invested in its outcome. Find—and listen to—the right mix of users, customers, executives who fund the project, government representatives who impose regulations, project teams, support teams and others.

## The payoff

Asking customers what outcome they are seeking helps you determine the true
and realistic product requirements that will deliver value to them.
