  Failure to communicate frequently
---

Failure to communicate with stakeholders early and often leads to one primary problem: rework. Developing a product for customers without consulting them while that product is being developed is just asking for trouble. The biggest reason it happens is that we often think we know what our customers want well enough that we don’t need to consult them. And stakeholders usually have different priorities. Sometimes teams don’t communicate with stakeholders because they prefer to avoid confrontations. But if you want a positive end result and minimum risk and rework, it is important to collaborate with stakeholders not just at the beginning of a project but throughout the entire process, from start to finish.

## Avoid the trap

- Identify key stakeholders, including customers. Choose a representative from each group to communicate with regularly.
- For large, in-person stakeholder workshops, consider using a skilled facilitator. Good facilitators are worth their weight in gold in keeping everyone on track for attaining the meeting objectives.
- Establish regular checkpoints with your stakeholders. Determine at the beginning of the project how often you need to check-in, and also schedule time for keeping stakeholders up-to-date as unexpected changes occur.
- Make it easy for your stakeholders to provide feedback. When they do, let others see their feedback to generate better discussions.

## The payoff

Regular communication reduces risks, increases team productivity and avoids
rework. Ultimately it helps deliver the product the customer really wants.
