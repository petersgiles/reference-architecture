   Ambiguous requirements
---

Ambiguous requirements are the result of unclear or missing critical information. This leads to confusion and rework. Project teams spend too much time trying to get clarification so they can design, code and test. It’s very difficult for architects to develop relevant models, developers to write defect-free code and testers to develop the right test cases without clear requirements. Unfortunately, reworking requirements is so common that it can become an accepted practice—rework is just built into the schedule and budget.

Ambiguity also tends to push risks into the next phase of the project. Requirements then have to be reworked, and that poses problems to project schedule and cost. This trap is especially damaging to fixed-cost projects. What causes ambiguity? Poor writing, inaccurate information and the assumption that the audience understands just as much as you do.

## Avoid the trap

- Use a writing reference, such as Elements of Style by William Strunk Jr. and E.B. White—which has long been considered the authoritative reference on writing crisp, clear text—before and during requirements creation.
- Create a glossary, and make sure every acronym and technical term is included.
- Pretend you are writing for a student just out of college or someone who recently joined the company. Don’t assume the audience will know every term and understand every concept.
- Augment text with visuals. It’s a great way to express both simple and complex concepts.
- Step back. After writing any draft document, put it down for a while and read it later. Fresh perspective can reveal ambiguities.

## The payoff

Clear, understandable requirements are the foundation of your software project.
