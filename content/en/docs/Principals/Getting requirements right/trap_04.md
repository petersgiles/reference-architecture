   Failure to communicate effectively
---

Ineffective communication is often a root cause of project failure. The perspective of development teams, customers, end users and executives is different for each group, as are their needs for communication. If you don’t express requirements using methods your stakeholders can easily understand, you can’t possibly gain consensus on requirements.

## Avoid the trap

- Know your audience and communicate in ways that help them understand the information. Make use of diagrams, user stories, sketching and storyboards.
- Create glossaries, document templates and feedback forms that are clear, concise and easy to use.
- Use prototyping to help stakeholders visualize the solution. This can either augment text or completely replace it depending on the level of detail required.
- Elicit feedback from all of your stakeholder representatives, and remember that one or two people tend to be the most vocal. Don’t make the mistake of overlooking others’ feedback.
- Always respond to feedback, preferably with some clear statement of status such as, “Will incorporate,” “Placed this on a wish list” or “Unable to accommodate this now.” If you ask for input, acknowledge it.

## The payoff

Effective communication makes the most efficient use of everyone’s valuable time and helps avoid misunderstandings that derail projects.
