   Failure to measure and assess requirements processes
---

Defining and managing requirements can be a complex task. Missing and ambiguous requirements can easily result in missed schedules, cost overruns and decreased productivity and quality as downstream project deliverables fail to provide value to stakeholders. Don’t wait for disaster to strike—assess your project status on a regular basis.

Organizations must have the ability to review, assess and improve their requirements process. Having accurate insight into data, processes and practices is a key component of success. Measuring project and process outcomes allow for continual process improvements across the software delivery lifecycle, which reduces project failures and lowers business costs.

## Avoid the trap

- As part of your process, conduct a “lessons learned” feedback session at the end of each development iteration or release.
- Also do a “lessons remembered” session before starting a new project. To encourage continual improvement, you need to not only capture lessons learned at the end of an iteration or release but also reinforce those lessons as you move forward.
- Define and collect metrics that ensure your success. For example, measure the impact of changes to your requirements, test case coverage, priority, cost and effort of business, and product requirements. As you become more experienced with measurement, you’ll find just the right combination of metrics that allows you to continually improve your requirements process.

## The payoff

Ongoing measurement of project performance reveals small problems before they become big issues.
