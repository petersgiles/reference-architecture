## Definition

An authoritative source of information about a specific subject area that guides and constrains the instantiations of multiple architectures and solutions.

## A Reference Architecture comprises the following components

- Introduction.  Identifies goals and objectives of the Reference Architecture and describes the specific purpose.
- Discussion.  Provides the background and rationale for the content of the Reference Architecture.  Headings are appropriate to the content.
- Principles.  High-level guidance for the entire Reference Architecture.
- Reference Model.  A taxonomy of accepted concepts to describe capability.
- Decision Frameworks.  Recommended combinations of Standards and Patterns for typical use cases based on the Reference Model.
- Standards.  Descriptions of preferred data formats or interface specifications that support the Reference Architectureâ€™s technical intent.
- Patterns.  Descriptions of preferred technologies, designs and data formats that solve specific use cases.

## Why use reference Architectures?

To facilitate multi-[site | vendor | organisation | *anything*] system creation and lifecycle support.

- providing a common lexicon and taxonomy
- providing a common (architectural) vision
- providing modularization and complementary context

Increase dynamic integration and achieve interoperability between many different and evolving systems.

- Articulation of domain and realization concepts
- Explicit modelling of functions and qualities above systems level
- Explicit decisions about compatibility, upgrade and interchangeability

To achieve increased complexity scope and size so that we may effectively create new products, product lines and product portfolios.

- providing guidance, e.g. architecture principles and practices
- providing an architecture baseline and an architecture blueprint
- capturing and sharing (architectural) patterns

## When to use Reference Architectures?

Reference Architectures facilitate the step towards product family architecture and evolvability; this often coincides with multi-\* problems. Single System Architectures tend to fall short in addressing the bigger set of problems that emerge in multi-system domains.

    section Multi-*
      product family architecture: 5: RA
      evolvable product family architecture: 5: RA

```

### Reference Architectures Elaborates Mission, Vision and Strategy
