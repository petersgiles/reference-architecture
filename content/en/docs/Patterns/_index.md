The simplest way to describe a pattern is that it provides a proven solution to a common problem individually documented in a consistent format and usually as part of a larger collection.

When specific questions need to be answered with a consistent approach or template solution, a pattern can be introduced. 

As patterns are independent documents that should be written to standalone in the pattern library.  ‘0001 – Architectural Patterns’ is the first pattern and is the template for Our patterns. New and existing patterns can be called out in the Reference Architecture to achieve a specific intent, they:

- can be used to ensure consistency in how systems are designed and built;
- are usually flexible and optional (and openly document the impacts of their application and even suggest alternative approaches); and
- can enrich the vocabulary of a given IT field because each pattern is given a meaningful name.

A Pattern’s authority to be applied comes from its use in a Reference Architecture.
