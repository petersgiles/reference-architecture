     Inability to adapt to change

Setting requirements in stone early in development can be a recipe for disaster that results in an enormous waste in resources and an inability to stay on schedule. As recent changes in the global economy illustrate, outside influences can quickly change project requirements. Organizations have quickly changed their focus to doing more with less. Speculative or experimental pet projects are off the table, replaced by those with strong potential ROI. Yet in any economy, there are always new requirements to contend with as business priorities change, new government regulations are enacted and new stakeholders are identified. Project teams need to accommodate those changes.

## Avoid the trap

- Expect and plan for requirements that change throughout your development process.
- Reprioritize requirements based on shifting circumstances such as business need, customer importance, estimated effort and cost.
- Have a fine-grain plan that you adjust at regular intervals.
- Keep your stakeholders informed as changes occurâ€”get their input for prioritization and the rationale behind it.

## The payoff

Accommodating and planning for change in project requirements helps mitigate risk and decreases costly rework.
