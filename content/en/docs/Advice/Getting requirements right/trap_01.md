    Trap 1 scope creep
---

Scope creep usually involves features being added to previously approved product
designs without corresponding increases in resources, schedule or budget. The
potential causes vary depending on the organization, the project and the individuals, but creep tends to occur when project requirements are not defined and
managed properly.

Uncontrolled growth can also occur when development teams create solutions
before determining what the business really needs. The business requirements
of a project are typically seen by development teams as being too high level
and vague and not applicable to them. They want to focus on detailed product
requirements. However, business requirements are real requirements, and they
need to be sufficiently detailed to avoid scope creep. By meeting the product
requirements and not the business ones, teams fail to develop solutions that
provide value and will overcompensate by adding features.

## Avoid the trap

- Map detailed, real business requirements to product features that satisfythose requirements and provide value.
- While accommodating change, be vigilant about focusing on business requirements and reprioritization.
- Identify and work with stakeholders early and often to understand the business requirements, stakeholder priorities and the effect on stakeholders when changes occur.

## The payoff

Avoiding scope creep makes planning easier, helps keep budgets intact and helps keep projects on schedule. Most important of all, it helps generate the desired return on investment (ROI).
