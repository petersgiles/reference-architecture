  Unwieldy documents and too much information
---

Do you have time to review and give feedback on a 200-page document? Probably not—and most likely, neither do your stakeholders. Doing more work than necessary and adding unnecessary detail to documentation costs both time and money. It is unproductive for the person creating it and a hindrance to the people looking for information they need to get their work done. Two common missteps include adding too much detail to requirements too early in the process and requiring more traceability than is necessary to facilitate effective lifecycle management. Think quality, not quantity. Better to add just enough detail to your requirements and identify just enough traceability to get the job done—not the entire job, but the next piece or iteration that needs to be completed.

## Avoid the trap

- Large, dense documents are not very consumable by stakeholders. Invest in communication tools that efficiently gather and disseminate requirements information.
- Use visual techniques to model business and product requirements. Business process diagrams and use case diagrams, storyboards and sketches can help cut through text-heavy clutter.
- Provide a glossary of industry terms, acronyms and domain-specific terms to facilitate communication.
- Create transparency of feedback. When your stakeholders are able to review each other’s feedback, the discussion is richer, problems come to light, missing requirements are identified and necessary details get filled in.
- Add just enough information to your documents so the rest of your team members can complete their work.
- Remember that requirements management is an ongoing process. There will be other opportunities to add more detail to requirements and to capture more traceability later when it may be more appropriate.

## The payoff

Focused documentation and feedback loops increase the efficiency of all stakeholders. Reduction of extraneous details in both requirements and traceability increases quality by focusing on the most important information—while postponing further detail until it’s needed.
