    Hidden project artifacts
---

Developers and testers often aren’t aware of the project vision or can’t locate the documentation for the architecture or the business requirements—that is, if they’re created at all. Without easy access to these foundational documents, how can we possibly expect them to deliver models, code and tests that solve the right customer problems? We can’t. Transparency to all project artifacts is critical to the success of any software project.

## Avoid the trap

- Keep all project artifacts in a central repository that is accessible by project team members. Having to search multiple sources for relevant documents is frustrating and time-consuming.
- Make sure documents are categorized and managed in such a way that they are easy to find.
- Ensure that when changes occur, the team is informed. Automatic notifications can help deliver this information.

## The payoff

Accessibility and management of information and transparency of project artifacts reduces rework, diminishes waste and promotes reuse because it makes collaboration and communication easier.
