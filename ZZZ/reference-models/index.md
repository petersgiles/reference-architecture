A taxonomy of accepted concepts to describe capability.

> A Reference model is an abstract framework for understanding significant relationships among the entities of [an] environment, and for the development of consistent standards or specifications supporting that environment. A reference model is based on a small number of unifying concepts and may be used as a basis for education and explaining standards to a non-specialist. A reference model is not directly tied to any standards, technologies, or other concrete implementation details, but it does seek to provide common semantics that can be used unambiguously across and between different implementations.

Within a Reference Architecture, the discussion and the subsequent introduction of taxonomies and their relationships results in a reference model that can be included in the overall Enterprise Architecture.

For a given taxonomy the terms that make it up can be flat or hierarchical.  The terms should form a complete, consistent set of like concepts and the thing that discriminates between the terms should be clearly articulated.

It is the Reference Model taxonomies that will form the basis for the Decision Framework.

**Standards.**  Like patterns, standards can be introduced in a Reference Architecture.  Indeed Reference Architectures are one method for making a standard authoritative.

**Decision Frameworks.** The application of the reference models, patterns and standards comprise a decision framework. The Decision Frame work is basically the logic that when applied to a set of variables or factors relating to a problem in the subject area covered by the Reference Architecture, results in appropriate patterns, standards or other guidelines being applied.
